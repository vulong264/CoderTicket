- Submitted by: **Your Name Here**
- Time spent: **X** hours
- URL: **Insert your Heroku URL here**
- SimpleCov Test Coverage: [coverage/index.html][coverage][index.html]

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Implement required user stories
* [ ] 10 model tests, 2 route tests, 2 controller tests, 2 view tests.

The person with best test coverage will win a small present from the instructor :)

#### Events

* [x] Users can see a list of upcoming events. Past events should not be shown.
    * **HINT**: Good candidate for a test. You can write test first --> fail --> fast similar to demo
    * Suggestions:
        * Implement `/upcoming` route test to go to 'events#index'
        * Implement `Event.upcoming` class method (with a test)
        * Implement `EventsController#index` action test
* [x] Users can search for events from the homepage.
* [x] Users can click on an event to see details about the event.
* [x] Users can click on "Book Now" to go to a page to purchase tickets.

#### Tickets

* [x] Each event can have multiple types of tickets, each with a different `price` and `max_quantity`.
* [x] Users can buy tickets to an event, choose the types of tickets, and the quantity of tickets.
* [ ] Users cannot buy more tickets than the quantity available.
* [ ] Users can only buy up to 10 of a ticket type at a time. Show a nice flash message.

#### Users

* [x] User can sign up by providing their email, password, and name.
* [x] User can login using an email and password.
* [x] Users can create events.
* [x] Users must click "publish event" before an event becomes viewable to other users.
    * **HINT**: use `published_at:datetime` and `Event.published` scope (class method)
    * Suggestions:
        * See [Add More RESTful Actions](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#adding-more-restful-actions) to add a `publish` POST action (member type)
        * Write a test to make sure only an event creator can publish an event
* [x] Users can create ticket types for that event.
    * **HINT**: make sure you understand what a ticket tpe is. Ask if not clear.
* [x] Users can create venues.
* [x] An event must have at least one `ticket_type` defined before it can be published.
    * **HINT**: add `Event#have_enough_ticket_types?` (and test it)
* [ ] User can see a list of events he or she has created.
    * Suggestions
        * You can use `/events/mine` [collection routes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#adding-more-restful-actions)
* [ ] Users can edit their event after creation. But only the user who created the event can edit the event.
    * **HINT**: use a `before_action :check_event_changing_permission` to redirect users to event page with a flash error if applicable.

### Optional Stories

* [ ] Users cannot buy tickets to events that occur in the past.
* [ ] Users can log in with Facebook.
* [ ] Users receive an email when they have purchased a ticket.
* [ ] Users can see "related events" when browsing an event. Related events should belong to the same category and be in the same region.
* [ ] User A can allow User B to edit User A's event. In other words, an event owner can assign other people to be "event admins".
* [ ] Ticket types have an optional "minimum" purchase quantity. ([Example Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/DOYtAR0.png))
* [ ] Events are automatically labeled as "Hot". "Hot" events should have a red border or some sort of visual flourish. The event title should also be prefixed with "**HOT:**".
* [ ] Instead of showing all of the events on the main page, an "admin" user can dictate the events that show up on the main page.
